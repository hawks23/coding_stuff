There is a static binary file called "static" and a BASH SCRIPT

>> wget both the files.

The static binary file by itself is meaningless.
The Bash script is a script that uses Objdump and decodes the binary file.
It extract the normal text data and puts it into    static.ltdis.strings.txt

the "static.ltdis.x86_64.txt", which gets compiled contains the assembly languange of the bash script.

>> bash ltdis.sh static

This will run the bash script with "static" as command line argument.
The compiled program returns two files. Cat the text file with strings in it.

It will contain the flag. Just search for it. Use grep, if must.
