There are 5 password cracking challenge.
Fairly simple.

But this one seems harder.

The password is encrypted and stored in one of the files.

The level5.py contains the code to decrypt the password. dictionary.txt contains many possible password combinations.

I'm gonna have to automate the script to read from "dictionary.txt" and pass in every value into the python files
individually.

def level_5_pw_check():
    f=open("dictionary.txt",'r')
    '''for i in f:
        print(i.strip('\n'))'''
    for i in f:
        pw = i.strip('\n')
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(pw)
        if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
            print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
            decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), pw)
            print(decryption)
            return
    print("That password is incorrect")

The following code was used and output was obtained
