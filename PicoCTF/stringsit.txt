There's a file called "strings" there.

Since the name of the challenge was strings it, i tried using strings function with
the strings file as the first parameter. It started printing many stings.
Then i used the same but grepped picoCTF and got the flag.

Apparantly, if we executed the file, they'll advice you to use the manual on 'strings' function.


https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings --> Refernce to strings CL function.
